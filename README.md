Explanation of solution:
-----------------------

- I dedicated a bit more of time than needed maybe
- Some advamced chess-functionalities are not present (towe by king exchange movement).
- with more time i would like to fully test more controllers, but i didn't want to expend more time on it.
- with more time i would like to clean-up a bit the formulas used for the movements.
